Their level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like they have beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
035.tentacle.office = "One large and highly active tentacle-like appendage seems to have grown outside the dead body of a scientist within office area [REDACTED]. Its level of aggression is unlike anything we've seen before - it looks like it has beaten some unfortunate Class D to death at some point during the breach."
049 = An active instance of SCP-049-2 was discovered in [REDACTED]. Terminated by Nine-Tailed Fox.
049.chamber = Three (3) active instances of SCP-049-2 discovered in the tunnel outside SCP-049's containment chamber. Terminated by Nine-Tailed Fox.

096 = A large amount of blood found in [DATA REDACTED]. DNA indentified as Subject D-9341. Most likely [DATA REDACTED] by SCP-096.
106.pd = Subject D-9341. Body partially decomposed by what is assumed to be SCP-106's "corrosion" effect. Body disposed of via incineration.
106.pd.crushed = In addition to the decomposed appearance typical of SCP-106's victims, the body exhibits injuries that have not been observed before: massive skull fracture, three broken ribs, fractured shoulder and multiple heavy lacerations.
106.pd.fall = In addition to the decomposed appearance typical of the victims of SCP-106, the subject seems to have suffered multiple heavy fractures to both of his legs.
173 = Subject D-9341. Cause of death: Fatal cervical fracture. Assumed to be attacked by SCP-173.
173.camera = Subject D-9341. Cause of death: Fatal cervical fracture. The surveillance tapes confirm that the subject was killed by SCP-173.
173.intro = Subject D-9341. Cause of death: Fatal cervical fracture. According to Security Chief Franklin who was present at SCP-173's containment chamber during the breach, the subject was killed by SCP-173 as soon as the disruptions in the electrical network started.
173.doors = "If I'm not mistaken, one of the main purposes of these rooms was to stop SCP-173 from moving further in the event of a containment breach. So, who's brilliant idea was it to put A GODDAMN MAN-SIZED VENTILATION DUCT in there?"
205 = The SCP-205 cycle seems to have resumed its normal course after the anomalies observed during [REDACTED]. The body of subject D-9341 was discovered inside the chamber. The subject exhibits signs of blunt force trauma typical for personnel who have entered the chamber when the lights are off.
420js = Subject D-9341 found in a comatose state in [DATA REDACTED]. The subject was holding what appears to be a cigarette while smiling widely. Chemical analysis of the cigarette has been inconclusive, although it seems to contain a high concentration of an unidentified chemical whose molecular structure is remarkably similar to that of tetrahydrocannabinol.
427 = "Requesting support from MTF Nu-7. We need more firepower to take this thing down."
895 = "What we know is that he died of cardiac arrest. My guess is that it was caused by SCP-895, although it has never been observed affecting video equipment from this far before. Further testing is needed to determine whether SCP-895's 'Red Zone' is increasing."
895.nvg = "Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, killing him."
895.finenvg = "Class D viewed SCP-895 through a pair of digital night vision goggles, presumably enhanced by SCP-914. It might be possible that the subject was able to resist the memetic effects partially through these goggles. The goggles have been stored for further study."
914.rough = "A heavily mutilated corpse found inside the output booth of SCP-914. DNA testing identified the corpse as Class D Subject D-9341. The subject had obviously been 'refined' by SCP-914 on the 'Rough' setting, but we are still confused as to how he ended up inside the intake booth and who or what wound the key.
914.superman = A Class D jumpsuit found in [DATA REDACTED]. Upon further examination, the jumpsuit was found to be filled with 12.5 kilograms of blue ash-like substance. Chemical analysis of the substance remains non-conclusive. Most likely related to SCP-914.
939 = "All four (4) escaped SCP-939 specimens have been captured and recontained successfully. Three (3) of them made quite a mess at Storage Area 6. A cleaning team has been dispatched."
1025.cardiacarrest = "He died of a cardiac arrest after reading SCP-1025, that's for sure. Is there such a thing as psychosomatic cardiac arrest, or does SCP-1025 have some anomalous properties we are not yet aware of?"
1123 = Subject D-9341 was shot dead after attempting to attack a member of Nine-Tailed Fox. Surveillance tapes show that the subject had been wandering around the site approximately 9 minutes prior, shouting the phrase "get rid of the four pests" in chinese. SCP-1123 was found in [REDACTED] nearby, suggesting the subject had come into physical contact with it. How exactly SCP-1123 was removed from its containment chamber is still unknown.
1048a = A dead body covered in ears was found in [REDACTED]. Subject was presumably attacked by an instance of SCP-1048-A and suffocated to death by the ears. Body was sent for autopsy.
1162 = A dead Class D subject was discovered within the containment chamber of SCP-1162. An autopsy revealed that his right lung was missing, which suggests interaction with SCP-1162.
1499 = The whereabouts of SCP-1499 are still unknown, but a recon team has been dispatched to investigate reports of a violent attack to a church in the Russian town of [REDACTED].
14991 = An unidentified male and a deceased Class D subject were discovered in [REDACTED] by the Nine-Tailed Fox. The man was described as highly agitated and seemed to only speak Russian. He's been taken into a temporary holding area at [REDACTED] while waiting for a translator to arrive.
14991.dimension = All personnel situated within Evacuation Shelter LC-2 during the breach have been administered Class-B amnestics due to Incident 1499-E. The Class D subject involved in the event died shortly after being shot by Agent [REDACTED].
guard.intro = Subject D-9341. Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head. The surveillance tapes confirm that the subject was terminated by Agent Ulgrin shortly after the site lockdown was initiated.
guard.gate.b = "Agent G. to control. Eliminated a Class D escapee in Gate B's courtyard."
apache = "CH-2 to control. Shot down a runaway Class D at {0}."
apache.gate.a = Gate A
apache.gate.b = Gate B
ntf = Subject D-9341. Terminated by Nine-Tailed Fox.
ntf.bloodloss = Subject D-9341. Died of blood loss after being shot by Nine-Tailed Fox.
tesla = Subject D-9341 killed by the Tesla gate at [REDACTED].
killbat = Subject D-9341 found dead inside SCP-914's output booth next to what appears to be an ordinary nine-volt battery. The subject is covered in severe electrical burns, and assumed to be killed via an electrical shock caused by the battery. The battery has been stored for further study.
suicide_1 = [REDACTED]
suicide_2 = Subject D-9341 found dead in Sector [REDACTED]. The subject appears to have attained no physical damage, and there is no visible indication as to what killed him. Body was sent for autopsy.
suicide_3 = EXCP_ACCESS_VIOLATION
suicide_4 = Subject D-9341 found dead in Sector [REDACTED]. The subject appears to have scribbled the letters "kys" in his own blood beside him. No other signs of physical trauma or struggle can be observed. Body was sent for autopsy.
gassed = Subject D-9341 found dead in [DATA REDACTED]. Cause of death: Suffocation due to decontamination gas.
